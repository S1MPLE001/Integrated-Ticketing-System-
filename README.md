# Integrated-Ticketing-System-

# Problem Statement:
Jaipur has many Public Sector Transport Service Providers: State Govt Bus Service, Indian Railways alongwith Metro with each having their own Ticketing System. All this results
in problems for passengers.They have to buy separate tickets, stand in long queues, pay via different modes for each operator.
 
# Solution:
We can get rid of this problem by developing a new Integrated Ticketing System.This system will be able to minimize various problems such as long queues for ticketing,difficult refunds and
keep in touch with transportfacility with the help of common mobile app.This app will serve as common platform for all transport service providers. Passengers will be able to generate their
tickets and make payments within no time.
